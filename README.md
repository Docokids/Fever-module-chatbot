## üîç About

This repository contains the source code for the **Fever Model** of **Docokids**, an AI-driven solution for pediatric fever assessment operating via a conversational API. The model has completed the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** phase and is currently progressing through **Feature Engineering** and **Model Fine-tuning**. The FastAPI-based API manages the conversation flow, maintains context, and allows for seamless switching between LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini, local) in an isolated manner.

## üåç Architecture

```
Client (WhatsApp bot)
   ‚Üì
FastAPI Application
   ‚îú‚îÄ Routers: /conversations, /providers, /health
   ‚îú‚îÄ Services: ConversationService, ProviderService
   ‚îú‚îÄ Repositories: Redis (fast), Postgres (audit)
   ‚îî‚îÄ LLM Adapters: OpenAIClient, GeminiClient, LocalLLMClient
```

- Implements the Repository and Dependency Injection patterns in FastAPI for scalability and testability.
- Metrics with Prometheus, JSON logging, and OpenTelemetry traces ensure observability in production.
