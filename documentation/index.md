# Pediatric Fever Chatbot API

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Fever Model** of **Docokids**, an AI-driven solution for pediatric fever assessment operating via a conversational API. This API leverages AI to assist in handling pediatric fever-related conversations, integrating seamlessly with platforms like DocoChat.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Responses**: Provides intelligent responses based on pediatric fever-related queries
- **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Sophisticated conversation system that simulates real pediatric consultations
- **DocoChat Integration**: Easily integrates with DocoChat for real-time communication
- **FastAPI Framework**: Built using FastAPI for high performance and ease of use
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides and references to assist developers
- **Multiple LLM Support**: Seamless switching between LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini, local)

## üß† Prompt Engineering System

The chatbot implements an advanced **prompt engineering system** that simulates real pediatric consultations through structured conversation phases:

### **Conversation Phases**

1. **INITIAL**: First interaction - asks for child's age
2. **DISCOVERY**: Symptom exploration - one question at a time
3. **ASSESSMENT**: Detailed evaluation - intensity, duration, behavior
4. **GUIDANCE**: Educational guidance and recommendations

### **Key Features**

- **One Question Per Response**: Ensures focused, natural conversation flow
- **Context-Aware Questions**: Adapts questions based on information already provided
- **Medical Safety Checks**: Automatic detection of emergency symptoms
- **Structured Discovery**: Progressive information gathering like real medical consultations
- **Pediatric Expertise**: Specialized prompts for child health assessment

For detailed documentation on the prompt engineering system, see [Prompt Engineering Guide](prompt-engineering.md).
