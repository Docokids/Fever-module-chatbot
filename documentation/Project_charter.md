# üìò Docokids Project Charter

## üåç Vision Statement

Docokids envisions a world where every child can access timely, reliable, and evidence-based medical guidance, regardless of their socio-economic background. Through innovative AI-driven technology, we aim to democratize access to pediatric healthcare, reducing disparities in medical attention for fever-related conditions, the most common concern among parents.

By leveraging artificial intelligence, open-source development, and strategic collaborations with organizations like UNICEF, we strive to empower caregivers with accessible and trustworthy healthcare insights, ultimately improving health outcomes for children across Latin America.

## üéØ Mission Statement

Docokids is committed to developing and maintaining an AI-powered chatbot that provides free, on-demand consultations about fever through WhatsApp, the most widely used messaging platform in Latin America.

Our mission is to bridge the gap in pediatric healthcare access, particularly for vulnerable populations, by offering real-time, evidence-based responses powered by a specialized large language model (LLM) trained on extensive medical data.

Through UNICEF's mentorship and funding, we integrate cutting-edge AI technology, ethical data management practices, and human-centered design to ensure that caregivers receive accurate, actionable, and culturally relevant health guidance. By prioritizing usability, security, and continuous improvement, we aim to build trust within communities and establish a scalable model for AI-driven pediatric healthcare assistance.
