## ðŸŽ¯ Load Balancing Implementation

**Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days  
**Area**: LLM Providers, Performance

### ðŸ“‹ Description

Implement automatic load balancing to distribute requests across multiple LLM providers, improving reliability and performance.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- [ ] Create a load balancer service that can distribute requests across available providers
- [ ] Implement health checks for each provider
- [ ] Add configuration options for load balancing strategies (round-robin, weighted, etc.)
- [ ] Integrate with existing provider factory system
- [ ] Add metrics to track load distribution

### ðŸ”§ Technical Details

**Files to modify/create:**
- `src/services/load_balancer.py` (new)
- `src/core/config.py` (add load balancing settings)
- `src/providers/factory.py` (integrate load balancer)
- `tests/test_load_balancer.py` (new)

**Key components:**
- Load balancer service with different strategies
- Provider health monitoring
- Configuration for load balancing preferences
- Integration with existing conversation service

### ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Familiarize yourself with the codebase:**
   - Review `src/providers/factory.py` to understand provider management
   - Check `src/services/conversation_service.py` to see how providers are used
   - Look at existing tests in `tests/` for patterns

2. **Study load balancing concepts:**
   - Round-robin distribution
   - Health checking mechanisms
   - Failover strategies

3. **Implementation approach:**
   - Start with a simple round-robin implementation
   - Add basic health checks
   - Integrate with existing provider system
   - Add tests

### ðŸ“š Resources

- [FastAPI Background Tasks](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/background-tasks/)
- [Python asyncio for concurrent operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
- [Health check patterns](https://microservices.io/patterns/reliability/health-check.html)

### âœ… Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Load balancer distributes requests across multiple providers
- [ ] Health checks prevent requests to unhealthy providers
- [ ] Configuration allows different load balancing strategies
- [ ] Tests cover load balancing functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated with load balancing features

### ðŸ’¡ Tips

- Start simple with round-robin, then add more sophisticated strategies
- Use async/await for non-blocking health checks
- Consider adding metrics to track which providers are being used
- Test with multiple provider configurations
