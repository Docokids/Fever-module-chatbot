## 🎯 A/B Testing Implementation

**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 days  
**Area**: Testing, Analytics, LLM Providers

### 📋 Description

Implement A/B testing capabilities to compare responses from different LLM providers, enabling data-driven decisions about which providers deliver the best quality responses for pediatric fever assessment.

### 🎯 Goals

- [ ] Create an A/B testing service for provider comparison
- [ ] Implement response quality evaluation metrics
- [ ] Add configuration for test groups and traffic distribution
- [ ] Create analysis tools for comparing provider performance
- [ ] Integrate with existing conversation flow

### 🔧 Technical Details

**Files to modify/create:**
- `src/services/ab_testing_service.py` (new)
- `src/models/ab_test.py` (new)
- `src/db/ab_test_repository.py` (new)
- `src/core/config.py` (add A/B testing settings)
- `src/services/conversation_service.py` (integrate A/B testing)
- `tests/test_ab_testing.py` (new)

**Key components:**
- Test group assignment and traffic distribution
- Response quality evaluation (medical accuracy, completeness, etc.)
- Statistical analysis of results
- Integration with conversation flow

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Familiarize yourself with the codebase:**
   - Review `src/services/conversation_service.py` for integration points
   - Check `src/models/` for data model patterns
   - Look at existing testing patterns in `tests/`

2. **Study A/B testing concepts:**
   - Statistical significance testing
   - Traffic distribution algorithms
   - Response quality metrics
   - Experiment design principles

3. **Implementation approach:**
   - Start with simple random assignment
   - Add basic response comparison
   - Implement statistical analysis
   - Create visualization tools

- [Statistical significance in A/B testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance)
- [Python statistical libraries](https://scipy.org/)
- [FastAPI testing patterns](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/testing/)

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A/B testing service assigns users to test groups
- [ ] System can compare responses from different providers
- [ ] Quality metrics are calculated and stored
- [ ] Statistical analysis shows significant differences
- [ ] Configuration allows easy test setup
- [ ] Tests cover A/B testing functionality
- [ ] Documentation explains how to interpret results

### 💡 Tips

- Start with simple metrics like response length and medical keyword presence
- Use consistent user assignment to ensure fair comparison
- Consider implementing blind evaluation where evaluators don't know which provider generated which response
- Add confidence intervals to statistical comparisons
- Make A/B testing configurable and non-intrusive

### 🔍 Example Implementation

```python
import random
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class ABTestResult:
    provider_a: str
    provider_b: str
    response_a: str
    response_b: str
    user_id: str
    test_id: str

class ABTestingService:
    def __init__(self, test_config: Dict):
        self.test_config = test_config
    
    def assign_test_group(self, user_id: str) -> str:
        """Assign user to test group A or B"""
        random.seed(user_id)  # Consistent assignment
        return "A" if random.random() < 0.5 else "B"
    
    def compare_responses(self, response_a: str, response_b: str) -> Dict:
        """Compare two responses and return quality metrics"""
        return {
            "length_diff": len(response_a) - len(response_b),
            "medical_keywords_a": self._count_medical_keywords(response_a),
            "medical_keywords_b": self._count_medical_keywords(response_b),
            "completeness_score_a": self._calculate_completeness(response_a),
            "completeness_score_b": self._calculate_completeness(response_b)
        }
    
    def _count_medical_keywords(self, response: str) -> int:
        # Count medical terms in response
        medical_terms = ["fever", "temperature", "symptoms", "doctor", "emergency"]
        return sum(1 for term in medical_terms if term.lower() in response.lower())
    
    def _calculate_completeness(self, response: str) -> float:
        # Calculate completeness score based on response structure
        # Implementation depends on expected response format
        pass
```

### 📊 Quality Metrics Ideas

- **Medical Accuracy**: Presence of medical keywords and concepts
- **Completeness**: Coverage of important fever assessment points
- **Clarity**: Readability and understandability scores
- **Safety**: Presence of appropriate medical disclaimers
- **Response Time**: Speed of response generation
