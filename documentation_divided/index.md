# ðŸ“š Documentation Overview

The documentation is now clearly separated into two areas: **User Guide** and **Developer Guide**.

| Section | Audience | Quick Links |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| [User Guide](user-guide/index.md) | Parents, caregivers and anyone who wants to *use* the chatbot API | Quick-start, API reference, prompt-engineering, privacy policy |
| [Developer Guide](dev-guide/index.md) | Contributors and maintainers who want to *work on* the code-base | Architecture, contributing, testing, project charter, code-of-conduct |

> **Note**  
> The original `documentation/` folder remains untouched.  All pages in these new guides link back to the canonical files so there is **no duplication** and no broken links.
